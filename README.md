# Practical Data Science

## University of Utah Statistics
I am very interested in Data Science.  I have completed a couple courses in the field.  Among the courses I have completed are:
* Programming for Data Science (Udacity)
* Data Analyst (Udacity)
* Survey of Statistical Packages (U of U)

### STAT 6969
Now I am enrolled in Practical Data Science.  I am becoming more familiar with coding programs like R, SAS, Python, and SQL.  We are exploring Data Visualization features in programs such as Tableau, as well as plotting features in the various programs mentioned.  I hope to begin my masters project this summer, and my work in this class will guide my in my success... hopefully!

### Professor: _Thomas Young_
Thomas Young is a part-time professor at U of U.  Mr. Young's day job is with the State of Utah.  He runs much of their data science and analytics.  He works with taxes, finances, and much more.  Thomas is bringing some of his work to our class.  

I met Thomas during the SAS section of Survey of Statistical Packages.  He is very supportive and enthusiastic in my growth with coding.  I asked Thomas if he would be willing to be part of my MSTAT committee.  I really need to find a chair member first, but Thomas is happy to help me with my program!
